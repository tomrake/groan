Testing for grunt tasks.

This is a quest for find out how to debug gruntjs tasks
-----

This quest started with a general web query on testing grunt tasks which resulted in useless advice.
I proceeded to ask the question how do grunt developers debug and test grunt?
The "use the source luke" answer are [The grunt tesing directory](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/tree/master/test).
